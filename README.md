# Context
This project was assigned as part of a Programming Languages course. The task was to use Racket (and more specifically, plait) to write an interpreter for a small toy language, Paret. The full assignment was adapted from the following assignment: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2021/interpreter.html. In particular, we were responsible for desugaring and ultimately evaluating inputs.
